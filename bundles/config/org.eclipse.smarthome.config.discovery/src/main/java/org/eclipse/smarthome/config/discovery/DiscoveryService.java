/**
 * The {@link DiscoveryService} is a service interface which each binding can implement
 * to provide an auto discovery process for one or more {@code Thing}s.
 * <p>
 * As an example, a typical discovery mechanism could scan the network for <i>UPnP</i>
 * devices, if requested.
 * <p>
 * A {@link DiscoveryService} must be able to finish its discovery process without any
 * user interaction.
 * <p>
 * <b>There are two different kind of executions:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Background discovery:</b> If this mode is enabled, the discovery process should 
 *   run in the background as long as this mode is not disabled again.</li>
 * <li><b>Active scan:</b> If an active scan is triggered, the the service should try to actively
 *   query for new devices and should report new results within the defined scan timeout. An active
 *   scan can be aborted.</li>
 * </ul>
